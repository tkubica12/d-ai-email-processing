- We use Azure so when giving cloud examples, use Azure solutions. 
- For Infrastructure as Code we use Terraform in this project. 
- Use Azure Developer CLI (azd) for local development and deployment.
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.
- Use docstrings to document functionality. 
- Comments only for things that are not obvious, not based on comments of progress, just to explain non-obvious lines worth extra documentation.
- Prefer simplicity and readability
- As you implement code, update docs/ImplementationLog.md with your progress and technical and architecture decisions
- Document common errors and pitfalls you encountered and had to fix in docs/CommonErrors.md, but only after I have confirmed issues are resolved and you have a solution.
- Continuously build short instructions how to run and test the project in README.md
- Try to avoid too big files, split code if it makes sense
- Do not proactively write any helper scripts outside of application code, only if asked to do so. If you think some helper script is needed, ask first.
