# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Email Ingestion and Storage Foundation

### Objectives
Establish the basic email processing pipeline that captures incoming emails, stores content and attachments in blob storage, and publishes events to Service Bus for downstream processing.

### Tasks

#### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- [x] **1.1 Initialize Azure Developer CLI project**
  - Set up azd configuration files (`azure.yaml`, `.azure/`)
  - Configure environment variables and parameters
  - Define resource naming conventions

- [x] **1.2 Create Terraform infrastructure modules**
  - Storage Account with blob storage configuration
  - Service Bus namespace and topic
  - Logic App Workflow (multitenant/consumption model)
  - Resource group and naming conventions
  - Managed identities and role assignments

#### 2. Logic App Development
- [ ] **2.1 Email trigger configuration**
  - [x] Configure Office 365 Outlook connector or Exchange connector
  - [x] Set up mailbox monitoring and filtering rules
  - [ ] Test email reception and trigger functionality
  - **Status**: ðŸ”¶ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Logic App Standard deployed successfully with Office 365 email trigger. AZD deployment working via zip deploy. Manual connection authentication and email testing required.

- [ ] **2.2 GUID generation and container creation**
  - [ ] Implement GUID generation action
  - [ ] Create blob storage container with generated GUID
  - [ ] Handle container creation errors and retries

- [ ] **2.3 Email content processing**
  - [ ] Extract email body and save as `body.txt`
  - [ ] Handle different email formats (plain text, HTML)
  - [ ] Preserve encoding and special characters

- [ ] **2.4 Attachment processing**
  - [ ] Extract all email attachments
  - [ ] Save attachments with original filenames
  - [ ] Handle filename conflicts and special characters
  - [ ] Support multiple attachment types

- [ ] **2.5 Service Bus message publishing**
  - [ ] Create JSON message with event details and file URLs
  - [ ] Publish to Service Bus topic
  - [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic

#### 3. Testing and Validation
- [ ] **3.1 Local development setup**
  - [ ] Configure local development environment
  - [ ] Set up test email accounts and mailboxes
  - [ ] Create sample test emails with various attachments

- [ ] **3.2 Integration testing**
  - [ ] End-to-end workflow testing
  - [ ] Verify file storage and Service Bus messaging
  - [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases

- [ ] **3.3 Performance validation**
  - [ ] Test with different email sizes and attachment counts
  - [ ] Validate storage performance and costs
  - [ ] Monitor Logic App execution metrics
