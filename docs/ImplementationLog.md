# Implementation Log

This log summarizes key implementation decisions, technical insights, and architectural changes for the Email Processing System. Entries are grouped by theme and major milestone for clarity. Redundant or overly detailed records have been removed for conciseness.

---

## 1. Infrastructure & Initial Setup

**Key Decisions & Actions:**
- Chose FastHTML for rapid Python web UI development
- Adopted uv for Python dependency management
- Used DefaultAzureCredential for secure, secretless Azure authentication
- Designed per-submission container storage in Azure Blob Storage
- Configured Azure Service Bus for event publishing
- Managed infrastructure with Terraform (including RBAC for local dev)

**Workflow:**
1. Deploy infrastructure with Terraform
2. Manually update `.env` from Terraform outputs
3. Authenticate with `az login`
4. Install dependencies with `uv sync`
5. Run with `uv run python main.py`

**Security & Scalability:**
- No secrets in code; all config via environment variables
- Stateless, container-ready app; Azure services handle scaling

---

## 2. Application Architecture & Code Quality

**Highlights:**
- Single-file FastHTML app for simplicity
- Clear separation of concerns (routes, processing, UI)
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Structured logging throughout
- Type safety and Pydantic models for message validation
- Responsive, modern UI

**Notable Improvements:**
- Enhanced error handling with specific exception types
- Switched to Python 3.9+ type hints (e.g., `list` instead of `List`)
- Added docstrings per project guidelines

---

## 3. Configuration & Setup Simplification

**Streamlining:**
- Removed helper scripts (`configure.py`, `run_dev.py`) for a simpler, manual setup
- Updated documentation to reflect manual `.env` configuration
- Direct execution via `uv run python main.py`

---

## 4. Progress Feedback Evolution

**Initial Approach:**
- Implemented HTMX-based progress indicator with step-by-step tracking and real-time updates
- Used in-memory progress tracker and async background processing

**Refinements:**
- Moved progress updates to reflect actual Azure operation timing (no artificial delays)
- Removed development mode and simulation logic for production focus
- Simplified progress feedback to generic status ("processing", "complete", "error")
- Final version: minimal state, immediate feedback, and clear separation of concerns for endpoints

**Rationale:**
- Simpler logic is more reliable and maintainable
- Users prefer clear "processing" feedback over detailed but potentially misleading step tracking

---

## 5. Messaging & Data Model

**Key Changes:**
- Migrated from plain dicts to Pydantic models for Service Bus messages
- Added `submittedAt` timestamp for traceability
- Enabled automatic JSON schema generation for future API documentation

**Example Model:**
```python
class SubmissionMessage(BaseModel):
    submissionId: str
    submittedAt: datetime
```

---

## 6. Service Bus Topic Naming

**Change:**
- Renamed topic from `email-events` to `new-submissions` for clarity
- Updated all code, infra, and documentation references

**Impact:**
- Requires Terraform redeployment and subscription update
- No data migration needed

---

## 7. Submission Intake Service Implementation

**Overview:**
- Implemented as an async Service Bus worker (not an API)
- Uses shared Pydantic model for message validation
- Explicit message acknowledgment to prevent redelivery
- Structured logging and error handling

**Key Features:**
- Async/await Service Bus operations
- Secure config via environment variables
- Infinite loop for continuous processing

---

## 8. Ongoing Improvements & Next Steps

**Planned/Completed:**
- Container deployment configuration
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Production environment setup
- Monitoring and logging integration
