## 1. Infrastructure & Initial Setup

**Key Decisions & Actions:**
- Chose FastHTML for rapid Python web UI development
- Adopted uv for Python dependency management
- Used DefaultAzureCredential for secure, secretless Azure authentication
- Designed per-submission container storage in Azure Blob Storage
- Configured Azure Service Bus for event publishing
- Managed infrastructure with Terraform (including RBAC for local dev)

**Workflow:**
1. Deploy infrastructure with Terraform
2. Manually update `.env` from Terraform outputs
3. Authenticate with `az login`
4. Install dependencies with `uv sync`
5. Run with `uv run python main.py`

**Security & Scalability:**
- No secrets in code; all config via environment variables
- Stateless, container-ready app; Azure services handle scaling

---

## 2. Application Architecture & Code Quality

**Highlights:**
- Single-file FastHTML app for simplicity
- Clear separation of concerns (routes, processing, UI)
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Structured logging throughout
- Type safety and Pydantic models for message validation
- Responsive, modern UI

**Notable Improvements:**
- Enhanced error handling with specific exception types
- Switched to Python 3.9+ type hints (e.g., `list` instead of `List`)
- Added docstrings per project guidelines

---

## 3. Configuration & Setup Simplification

**Streamlining:**
- Removed helper scripts (`configure.py`, `run_dev.py`) for a simpler, manual setup
- Updated documentation to reflect manual `.env` configuration
- Direct execution via `uv run python main.py`

---

## 4. Progress Feedback Evolution

**Initial Approach:**
- Implemented HTMX-based progress indicator with step-by-step tracking and real-time updates
- Used in-memory progress tracker and async background processing

**Refinements:**
- Moved progress updates to reflect actual Azure operation timing (no artificial delays)
- Removed development mode and simulation logic for production focus
- Simplified progress feedback to generic status ("processing", "complete", "error")
- Final version: minimal state, immediate feedback, and clear separation of concerns for endpoints

**Rationale:**
- Simpler logic is more reliable and maintainable
- Users prefer clear "processing" feedback over detailed but potentially misleading step tracking

---

## 5. Messaging & Data Model

**Key Changes:**
- Migrated from plain dicts to Pydantic models for Service Bus messages
- Added `submittedAt` timestamp for traceability
- Enabled automatic JSON schema generation for future API documentation

**Example Model:**
```python
class SubmissionMessage(BaseModel):
    submissionId: str
    submittedAt: datetime
```

---

## 6. Service Bus Topic Naming

**Change:**
- Renamed topic from `email-events` to `new-submissions` for clarity
- Updated all code, infra, and documentation references

**Impact:**
- Requires Terraform redeployment and subscription update
- No data migration needed

---

## 7. Submission Intake Service Implementation

**Overview:**
- Implemented as an async Service Bus worker (not an API)
- Uses shared Pydantic model for message validation
- Explicit message acknowledgment to prevent redelivery
- Structured logging and error handling

**Key Features:**
- Async/await Service Bus operations
- Secure config via environment variables
- Infinite loop for continuous processing

---

## 8. Ongoing Improvements & Next Steps

**Planned/Completed:**
- Container deployment configuration
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Production environment setup
- Monitoring and logging integration

## 2025-07-10 - Fixed docproc-parser-foundry DocumentContentExtractedEvent and partition key issues

### Issues Fixed

1. **Missing documentId in DocumentContentExtractedEvent data**: Added `documentId` field to `DocumentContentExtractedEventData` model and updated the change feed processor to include it when emitting events.

2. **Partition key inconsistency**: Fixed inconsistency between Design document, Terraform configuration, and DocumentRecord model:
   - Terraform specifies `/submissionId` as partition key for documents container
   - Updated DocumentRecord model to correctly reflect `submissionId` as partition key (was incorrectly showing `documentUrl`)
   - Updated change feed processor to use correct partition key when reading/writing documents

3. **Event ID generation syntax error**: Fixed malformed UUID generation in event creation (`uuid.uuid4()"` → `str(uuid.uuid4())`)

### Technical Details

- **DocumentContentExtractedEventData**: Now includes both `documentUrl` and `documentId` fields, matching the design specification
- **DocumentRecord**: Updated model documentation to reflect correct partition key (`submissionId`)
- **Change Feed Processor**: Updated to use `submissionId` as partition key when interacting with documents container
- **Event Generation**: Fixed event ID format to use clean UUID without prefix

### contentLength Calculation

The contentLength calculation (`len(markdown_content)`) appears to be correct. If contentLength is still showing as 0, it could be due to:
1. Document Intelligence service not extracting content (unreadable documents)
2. Processing failures resulting in empty content
3. Actually empty documents

The system properly handles both success and failure cases:
- Success: `contentLength = len(markdown_content)`
- Failure: `contentLength = 0` with `success = false`

### Architecture Impact

This ensures consistency across all document events (DocumentContentExtractedEvent, DocumentClassifiedEvent, DocumentIndexedEvent) - all now properly include `documentId` in their data payloads, enabling downstream services to efficiently identify and process specific documents. Event IDs are now clean UUIDs without prefixes.

## 2025-07-10 - Document Classifier Service Implementation

### Overview
Implemented a complete document classification service (`docproc-classifier`) that processes `DocumentContentExtractedEvent` events from Cosmos DB Change Feed and classifies documents using Azure OpenAI API.

### Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Azure OpenAI Integration**: 
   - Used Azure OpenAI service with AAD authentication (DefaultAzureCredential) instead of regular OpenAI API
   - Implemented structured outputs using Pydantic models to ensure consistent JSON response format
   - Used Jinja2 templates for system prompts, allowing easy customization of classification instructions

2. **Event-Driven Processing**:
   - Reused Change Feed processor pattern from `docproc-parser-foundry` service
   - Filtered for `DocumentContentExtractedEvent` events specifically
   - Emits `DocumentClassifiedEvent` after successful classification for downstream processing

3. **Document Classification Types**:
   - Defined enum with predefined document types: `invoice`, `contract`, `bankStatement`, `submissionNotes`, `other`
   - Used structured outputs to enforce classification within these categories
   - Generates both document type and summary in single API call

4. **Data Management**:
   - Updates existing document records in Cosmos DB with classification results
   - Uses correct partition key (`submissionId`) for efficient document access
   - Handles Cosmos DB internal fields using Pydantic `extra="ignore"` configuration

### Technical Implementation Highlights

1. **Configuration Management**:
   - Extended config system to support Azure OpenAI configuration
   - Maintained consistency with existing services for Cosmos DB and Table Storage settings
   - Used environment variables for all configuration (no secrets in code)

2. **Error Handling & Resilience**:
   - Comprehensive error handling for OpenAI API calls, Cosmos DB operations, and JSON serialization
   - Graceful handling of classification failures with dummy events for error tracking
   - Proper resource cleanup with async context managers

3. **Structured Outputs**:
   - Leveraged OpenAI's structured output feature with Pydantic schema validation
   - Ensures LLM responses always match expected JSON structure
   - Eliminates need for post-processing or validation of LLM outputs

### Key Fixes and Lessons Learned

1. **Pydantic Model Serialization**:
   - Issue: DateTime objects not JSON serializable when using `model_dump()`
   - Solution: Use `model_dump_json()` then `json.loads()` for proper datetime handling
   - Learning: Always use proper Pydantic serialization methods for complex objects

2. **Configuration Field Naming**:
   - Issue: Inconsistent field names between config model and service access
   - Solution: Ensure config field names match throughout codebase
   - Learning: Maintain naming consistency across configuration definitions and usage

3. **Azure SDK Dependencies**:
   - Issue: Missing Azure SDK packages causing import errors
   - Solution: Added all required Azure packages to `pyproject.toml`
   - Learning: Explicitly declare all Azure SDK dependencies rather than relying on transitive dependencies

### Service Architecture

```
DocumentContentExtractedEvent → Change Feed Processor → Document Classifier → 
Update Document Record → Emit DocumentClassifiedEvent
```

**Processing Flow**:
1. Listen to Cosmos DB Change Feed for `DocumentContentExtractedEvent`
2. Fetch document content from documents container using `documentId`
3. Send content to Azure OpenAI with system prompt template
4. Update document record with classification results (`type` and `summary` fields)
5. Emit `DocumentClassifiedEvent` for downstream services

### Performance Considerations

- **Continuation Tokens**: Stateful processing with optional Azure Table Storage persistence
- **Batch Processing**: Processes Change Feed events in batches for efficiency
- **Async Operations**: Fully async implementation for better resource utilization
- **Error Recovery**: Continues processing on individual document failures

### Dependencies Added

```toml
dependencies = [
    "azure-cosmos>=4.9.0",
    "azure-data-tables>=12.7.0", 
    "azure-identity>=1.23.0",
    "jinja2>=3.1.4",
    "openai>=1.93.3",
    "pydantic>=2.11.7",
]
```

### Future Enhancements

- Consider caching system prompts for better performance
- Add metrics and monitoring for classification accuracy
- Implement classification confidence scoring
- Support for custom document types through configuration

This implementation completes the document processing pipeline's classification stage, providing reliable and consistent document categorization with full event traceability.
