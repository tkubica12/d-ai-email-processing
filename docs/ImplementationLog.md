## Phase 2: Pydantic Model Integration and Message Structure (2025-07-07)

### Objective
Migrate from plain dictionary message structure to Pydantic models for better data validation, serialization, and type safety.

### Technical Decisions
1. **Pydantic Models**: Use Pydantic for Service Bus message structure
2. **Type Safety**: Leverage Python type hints and validation
3. **JSON Schema**: Automatic generation for API documentation
4. **Timestamp Tracking**: Add `submittedAt` field to track submission time

### Implementation Details

#### Created Pydantic Model (`models.py`)
```python
class SubmissionMessage(BaseModel):
    submissionId: str = Field(description="Unique GUID identifier for the submission")
    userId: str = Field(description="Email address of the user submitting the request")
    documentUrls: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="List of Azure Blob Storage URLs")
    submittedAt: datetime = Field(description="ISO 8601 timestamp when submission was created")
```

---

## Phase 3: HTMX Progress Indicator Implementation (2025-07-07)

### Objective
Replace JavaScript-based progress indicator with server-side HTMX solution for real-time progress feedback during submission processing.

### Technical Approach
1. **HTMX Polling**: Use `hx-trigger="every 800ms"` for automatic progress updates
2. **Server-Side Progress Tracking**: In-memory dictionary to track submission progress
3. **Background Processing**: Async task to process submissions while updating progress
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, uses only HTMX attributes

### Implementation Details

#### Progress Tracking System
- **In-Memory Store**: `progress_tracker` dictionary for current progress state
- **Background Task**: `process_submission_background()` updates progress asynchronously
- **Real-Time Updates**: Client polls `/progress/{submission_id}` endpoint every 800ms

#### HTMX Integration Pattern
```html
<div hx-trigger="load" 
     hx-get="/progress/{submission_id}" 
     hx-target="this" 
     hx-swap="outerHTML">
</div>
```

#### Progress States
1. **Validating submission** (Step 1/5)
2. **Creating storage container** (Step 2/5)  
3. **Uploading message body** (Step 3/5)
4. **Uploading attachments** (Step 4/5, if files present)
5. **Sending notification** (Step 5/5)

#### User Experience Flow
1. User submits form → Redirected to progress page
2. Progress page loads → HTMX starts polling progress endpoint
3. Progress updates automatically → Visual progress bar and status text
4. Completion → Auto-redirect to success page

### Technical Benefits
- **No JavaScript Required**: Pure server-side rendering with HTMX
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users see actual progress of their submission
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works even if HTMX fails to load
- **Server-Side Control**: Progress logic controlled entirely by server
- **Accessible**: Progress updates work with screen readers

### Architecture Decision
**Background Processing**: Submissions now process asynchronously, allowing immediate user feedback while maintaining the same Azure integration functionality.

---

### Progress Timing Fix (2025-07-07)

#### Issue Identified
The progress indicator was running much faster than actual processing because:
1. **Simulated Steps**: `process_submission_background()` used artificial `asyncio.sleep()` delays
2. **Delayed Real Work**: Actual Azure processing happened after all progress steps were "complete"
3. **Misleading UI**: Users saw 100% complete while Azure operations were still running

#### Solution Implemented
1. **Real-Time Progress**: Moved progress updates into `process_submission_azure()` 
2. **Actual Work Timing**: Progress now updates as real Azure operations complete
3. **Removed Simulation**: Eliminated artificial delays in favor of real processing feedback

#### Code Changes
- **process_submission_azure()**: Now updates `progress_tracker` during actual operations
- **process_submission_background()**: Simplified to directly call Azure processing
- **Development Mode**: Keeps simulated timing only when Azure services unavailable

#### Progress Flow (Fixed)
1. **Step 1**: Starting Azure processing (immediate)
2. **Step 2**: Creating storage container (real Azure blob operation)
3. **Step 3**: Uploading message body (real file upload)
4. **Step 4**: Uploading attachments (real file uploads, updates per file)
5. **Step 5**: Sending Service Bus message (real message publication)

Now the progress indicator accurately reflects actual processing time and operations.

---

## Development Mode Removal (2025-07-07)

#### Simplification
Removed all development mode simulation code to focus on production-ready Azure integration:

1. **Eliminated Simulated Progress**: Removed artificial progress steps with `asyncio.sleep()` delays
2. **Azure-Only Processing**: Application now requires Azure services to function
3. **Cleaner Code**: Simplified `process_submission_background()` to only handle real operations
4. **Fail-Fast Startup**: Application exits with error if Azure clients can't be initialized

#### Code Changes
- **process_submission_background()**: Simplified to only call Azure processing
- **main()**: Now exits with error if Azure services unavailable
- **Removed**: All development mode simulation logic and artificial delays

#### Benefits
- **Production Focus**: Code is now optimized for real deployment scenarios
- **Clearer Logic**: No conditional development vs production paths
- **Reliable Progress**: Progress tracking only reflects actual Azure operations
- **Error Clarity**: Clear failure messages when Azure configuration is missing

The application now requires proper Azure configuration and provides authentic progress feedback based on real processing operations.

---

## Simplified Progress Feedback (2025-07-07)

### Objective
Simplify the progress indicator from step-by-step tracking to a generic "Processing..." message with simple completion feedback.

### Technical Changes
1. **Removed Step Tracking**: Eliminated complex step/total_steps progress bar logic
2. **Simplified Status**: Progress now uses simple status values: "processing", "complete", "error"
3. **Generic Messaging**: Single "Processing..." message instead of detailed step descriptions
4. **Direct Redirect**: Automatic redirect to result page on completion using client-side redirect

### Implementation Details

#### Progress States Simplified
- **processing**: Shows generic "Processing your submission..." message
- **complete**: Triggers automatic redirect to result page
- **error**: Displays error message with retry option

#### User Experience Flow
1. User submits form → Redirected to progress page with generic processing message
2. HTMX polls every 500ms → Checks simple status (processing/complete/error)
3. Processing complete → Automatic redirect to detailed result page
4. Error state → Shows error message with retry link

#### Code Simplification
- **Progress Tracker**: Now stores only status and message (no step counting)
- **Background Processing**: No intermediate progress updates, just final status change
- **Progress Endpoint**: Simple status check and redirect logic
- **Removed CSS**: Eliminated progress bar styles in favor of simple text feedback

### Benefits
- **Reliability**: Less complex logic means fewer potential failure points
- **User Clarity**: Simple "processing" vs "complete" is clearer than step percentages
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and debug with simpler state management
- **Performance**: Fewer updates and calculations during processing

### Architecture Decision
**Simplicity Over Detail**: Users prefer knowing "something is happening" over detailed step tracking that may not accurately reflect processing complexity.

---

## Final Simplification: Minimal Progress Tracking (2025-07-07)

### Objective
Reduce complexity further by removing all unnecessary progress tracking infrastructure while maintaining immediate user feedback.

### Technical Changes
1. **Eliminated Complex Progress Tracker**: Removed step-by-step progress tracking entirely
2. **Simple Status Model**: Only track 'waiting', 'processing', 'complete', 'error' states
3. **Deferred Processing**: Background processing starts after progress page loads (prevents blocking)
4. **Minimal State**: Store only essential data needed for results page

### Implementation Details

#### Flow Simplified
1. **Form Submit** → Store submission data with status 'waiting', return progress page immediately
2. **Progress Page Load** → Trigger `/start/{submission_id}` after 100ms delay
3. **Start Endpoint** → Change status to 'processing', start background Azure operations, return polling div
4. **Polling** → Check status every second until 'complete' or 'error'
5. **Complete** → Redirect to result page with submission details

#### Code Simplification
- **submission_results**: Single dictionary with status, basic data, and error messages
- **No Progress Steps**: No step counting, percentages, or detailed progress messages
- **Clean Separation**: Form submission, processing trigger, status checking are separate concerns

### Benefits
- **Immediate Feedback**: Progress page shows instantly after form submission
- **Simple Logic**: Minimal state management reduces bugs and complexity
- **Clear Flow**: Each endpoint has a single, clear responsibility
- **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and modify the progress system

The application now provides the simplest possible progress feedback while maintaining a professional user experience with real-time status updates.

### Deployment Impact
- Requires Terraform re-deployment to update the Service Bus topic name
- Existing subscriptions will need to be updated to reference the new topic name
- No data migration required as this is a naming change only

---

## Phase 2: Submission Intake Service Implementation (2025-07-07)

### Service Overview
Implemented the submission-intake service as an async Service Bus worker that processes incoming submission messages from the client-web application.

### Technical Decisions
1. **Worker Pattern**: Designed as a background worker, not an API service
2. **Async Processing**: Full async/await pattern for Service Bus operations
3. **Message Acknowledgment**: Explicit acknowledgment after processing to prevent redelivery
4. **Shared Models**: Imports SubmissionMessage model from client-web to maintain consistency

  topic_id            = azurerm_servicebus_topic.new_submissions.id
  max_delivery_count  = 10
  dead_lettering_on_message_expiration = true
  dead_lettering_on_filter_evaluation_error = true
}
```

---

## Phase 2: Cosmos DB Implementation (2025-07-07)

### Infrastructure Enhancement
Added serverless Cosmos DB for event sourcing and data persistence as defined in the architecture design.

### Technical Decisions
1. **Serverless Cosmos DB**: Cost-effective for variable workloads with automatic scaling
2. **Event Sourcing Pattern**: Using Cosmos DB change feed for event processing triggers
3. **Container Design**: Three containers aligned with domain boundaries:
   - `events`: Event sourcing with `/submissionId` partition key
   - `documents`: Document processing results with `/documentUrl` partition key  
   - `submissions`: Submission records with `/submissionId` partition key
4. **RBAC Approach**: Custom role definition with minimal required permissions for security

### Implementation Details

#### Cosmos DB Resources (Terraform)
```hcl
# cosmosdb.tf - New file created
resource "azurerm_cosmosdb_account" "main" {
  offer_type = "Standard"
  capabilities {
    name = "EnableServerless"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_database" "main" {
  name = "email-processing"
}

# Three containers for different data domains
resource "azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container" "events"
resource "azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container" "documents" 
resource "azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container" "submissions"
```

#### Security Configuration
- **Custom Role Definition**: `EmailProcessingDataContributor` with specific data plane permissions
- **RBAC Assignment**: Current user granted access for local development
- **Partition Strategy**: Logical partitioning by submission ID and document URL for optimal query performance

#### Schema Design
- **Events Container**: Change feed enabled for event processing pipeline
- **Unique Constraints**: Event ID uniqueness to prevent duplicate events
- **Partition Keys**: Optimized for query patterns and cross-partition query minimization

### Next Steps
- Implement event publishing in submission-intake service
- Create change feed processors for document processing services
- Add connection configuration to application services

---

## Phase 3: Submission-Intake Cosmos DB Integration (2025-07-07)

### Cosmos DB Storage Implementation
Implemented initial submission document storage in Cosmos DB following the exact schema defined in Design.md.

### Technical Decisions
1. **Schema Compliance**: Implemented models strictly following Design.md schema specification
   - `SubmissionDocument`: Matches submissions container schema exactly
   - `DocumentInfo`: Tracks document processing state with `processed` and `type` fields
2. **Async Operations**: Full async/await pattern for Cosmos DB operations
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging and message abandonment
4. **Resource Management**: Proper initialization and cleanup of Cosmos DB connections

### Implementation Details

#### Data Models (`models.py`)
```python
class DocumentInfo(BaseModel):
    """Document info matching Design.md schema"""
    documentUrl: str
    processed: Optional[datetime] = None
    type: Optional[str] = None

class SubmissionDocument(BaseModel):
    """Submission document following Design.md schema"""
    id: str  # Same as submissionId
    submissionId: str  # Partition key
    userId: str
    submittedAt: datetime
    documents: List[DocumentInfo]
```

#### Storage Operations (`storage.py`)
- **CosmosDBStorage**: Async storage operations class
- **store_submission()**: Creates submission documents from Service Bus messages
- **get_submission()**: Retrieves submissions by ID
- **Proper Authentication**: Uses DefaultAzureCredential for RBAC

#### Service Integration (`main.py`)
- **Integrated Storage**: Storage initialization in message processing loop
- **Message Processing**: Store submissions immediately upon message receipt
- **Error Handling**: Proper message acknowledgment/abandonment based on storage success
- **Resource Cleanup**: Ensures Cosmos DB client is properly closed

### Configuration Updates
- **Environment Variables**: Added Cosmos DB endpoint and container configuration
- **Dependencies**: Added azure-cosmos>=4.8.0 for async Cosmos DB operations
- **Config Model**: Extended CosmosDBConfig with container name configuration

### Status
- ✅ Submission document storage implemented
- ✅ Schema compliance with Design.md
- ✅ Async operations with proper error handling
- ⏳ Event emission (next phase)
- ⏳ Document processing pipeline integration

The service now successfully stores initial submission documents in Cosmos DB using the exact schema defined in the architecture design, providing the foundation for the event sourcing workflow.

---

## Event Models Implementation (July 7, 2025)

### Added Pydantic Event Schemas
Implemented event models in `src/submission-intake/models.py` based on Design.md specifications:

**SubmissionCreatedEvent**: 
- Emitted when a new submission is successfully created and stored
- Contains submission metadata including message length and container information
- Follows the exact JSON schema from Design.md

**DocumentUploadedEvent**:
- Emitted for each document when a submission is created  
- Triggers document processing by parser services
- Contains document URL for processing

**Architecture Decision**: Using Pydantic models for event validation ensures type safety and consistent serialization across services. Events follow the standardized format with id, eventType, submissionId, userId, timestamp, and data fields.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Event models use proper Pydantic validation with Field descriptions
- Included comprehensive examples in Config classes for documentation
- Maintained consistency with existing model patterns in the codebase

### Event Creation Logic Implementation
Added event creation and storage functionality to the submission-intake service:

**CosmosDBStorage Enhancements**:
- Added `_events_container` reference for events container access
- Implemented `create_submission_created_event()` method for event creation and storage
- Automatic UUID generation for unique event identifiers

**Event Processing Flow**:
1. Store submission document in submissions container
2. Create SubmissionCreatedEvent with submission metadata
3. Store event in events container for event sourcing
4. Log successful event creation for monitoring

**Event Data Population**:
- `documentUrls`: Copied from original submission message
- `containerName`: Set to submissionId (following Design.md pattern)
- `timestamp`: Generated at event creation time using UTC

**Error Handling**: Events are created after successful submission storage, ensuring data consistency. Failed event creation will still allow message reprocessing.

### Event Schema Simplification (July 7, 2025)
**Removed messageLength field** from SubmissionCreatedEvent schema:
- **Design.md**: Updated event format to remove messageLength from data payload
- **Pydantic Models**: Removed messageLength field from SubmissionCreatedData
- **Implementation**: Removed messageLength calculation from storage.py
- **Documentation**: Updated implementation log and removed obsolete references

**Rationale**: The messageLength field was not providing meaningful value for event processing and added unnecessary complexity to the event creation logic.

### DocumentUploadedEvent Implementation & Code Refactoring (July 7, 2025)

**DocumentUploadedEvent Implementation**:
- Added `create_document_uploaded_events()` method to create individual events for each document
- Each document gets a unique event with its own UUID for parallel processing
- Events follow Design.md schema with documentUrl in the data payload

**Code Refactoring for Event Creation**:
- Introduced generic `_create_and_store_event()` method to eliminate code duplication
- Refactored both `create_submission_created_event()` and `create_document_uploaded_events()` to use common logic
- Added TypeVar for type safety with generic event handling
- Improved error handling and logging consistency across event types

**Event Processing Flow**:
1. Store submission document in submissions container
2. Create SubmissionCreatedEvent with submission metadata  
3. Create DocumentUploadedEvent for each document URL
4. Store all events in events container for downstream processing
5. Log successful event creation for monitoring

**Technical Benefits**:
- **Code Reuse**: Generic event creation reduces duplication and maintenance overhead
- **Type Safety**: TypeVar ensures proper typing for different event types
- **Consistency**: Unified error handling and logging patterns across event creation
- **Scalability**: Each document triggers independent processing pipeline

**Event Emission**: The service now emits N+1 events per submission (1 SubmissionCreated + N DocumentUploaded events), enabling parallel document processing by downstream services.

### Event Creation Architecture Decision (July 7, 2025)

**Problem**: Event creation methods had similar patterns, raising the question of whether to further abstract the code or maintain separate domain-specific interfaces.

**Options Evaluated**:

1. **Two Public Interfaces Separated**: Completely separate methods with no shared logic
   - Pros: Clear intent, type safety, simple usage
   - Cons: Code duplication, maintenance overhead

2. **Two Public Interfaces with Shared Private Logic** (Selected): Domain-specific methods using shared storage implementation
   - Pros: Clear interfaces + DRY storage logic, easy to extend, separation of concerns
   - Cons: Some duplication in event object creation patterns

3. **Factory + Single Public Interface**: Factory methods for event creation + generic storage method
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility, pure functions, testability
   - Cons: Complex API, easy to misuse, type complexity

4. **Single Generic Interface**: One method handling all event types via type dispatch
   - Pros: Single interface, batch operations
   - Cons: Complex implementation, loss of type safety, unclear interface

**Decision: Option 2 - Domain-Specific Interfaces with Shared Storage Logic**

**Rationale**:
- **Domain Alignment**: Methods naturally match business logic (1 SubmissionCreated vs N DocumentUploaded events)
- **Clear API Contract**: Callers know exactly what they're getting with proper type safety
- **Balanced Abstraction**: Storage logic is shared (DRY) while domain logic remains specific
- **Extensibility**: New event types follow established pattern with shared infrastructure
- **Practical Simplicity**: Easy for developers to understand, follows common event-driven patterns

**Implementation**: 
- `create_submission_created_event()` and `create_document_uploaded_events()` provide domain-specific interfaces
- `_create_and_store_event()` handles common storage logic, error handling, and logging
- TypeVar ensures type safety while enabling generic storage operations

This approach provides the optimal balance of code reuse, maintainability, and API clarity for our event sourcing implementation.

## Phase 2: Document Processing Architecture Redesign (2025-07-07)

### Architectural Changes
Updated the document processing pipeline to use Azure Document Intelligence and implement parallel processing steps for better scalability and feature separation.

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Azure Document Intelligence**: Primary document processing using Azure's native capability to convert documents to Markdown while preserving structure
2. **Parallel Processing**: Split document processing into three parallel streams after content extraction:
   - Classification and summarization using LLM
   - Search indexing in Azure AI Search
   - Structured data extraction using LLM
3. **Event-Driven Coordination**: Use Cosmos DB Change Feed to coordinate between processing steps
4. **Flexible Data Model**: Support for extensible extractedData structure based on document types

### Updated Service Architecture
- **docproc-parser-foundry**: Uses Azure Document Intelligence for content extraction to Markdown
- **docproc-classifier**: LLM-based document classification and summarization
- **docproc-search-indexer**: Ingests content into Azure AI Search with metadata
- **docproc-data-extractor**: LLM-based structured data extraction
- **docproc-aggregator**: Coordinates completion tracking across parallel processes
- **submission-analyzer**: Final evaluation once all document processing is complete

### Data Model Updates
- **Document Store**: Added `type`, `extractedData`, and `metadata.indexed` fields
- **Submission Store**: Added `evaluationResults` and updated document tracking with `processed` and `type` flags
- **Event Model**: Expanded with new event types for each processing step

### Processing Flow
1. Document uploaded → Azure Document Intelligence extracts content as Markdown
2. Parallel processing:
   - LLM classifies document type and creates summary
   - Content indexed in Azure AI Search with userId/submissionId metadata
   - LLM extracts structured data based on document type
3. Aggregator waits for all parallel processes to complete
4. Submission analyzer evaluates complete submission with all processed documents

## Phase 3: Document Parser Foundry Service Setup (2025-07-09)

### Service Architecture Design
- **Event Processing**: Cosmos DB Change Feed listener for `DocumentUploadedEvent`
- **Document Analysis**: Azure Document Intelligence Layout API integration
- **Content Storage**: Processed documents stored in `documents` container
- **Event Publishing**: Emits `DocumentContentExtractedEvent` upon completion

### Technical Decisions
1. **Async Framework**: Pure asyncio for Change Feed processing efficiency
2. **Configuration Pattern**: Consistent with submission-intake service structure
3. **Event Sourcing**: Idempotent processing using event IDs
4. **Pydantic Models**: Comprehensive type safety for all data structures

## Phase 5: Continuation Token Persistence and Processing Architecture (2025-07-09)

### Key Implementations

#### 1. Azure Table Storage for Continuation Token Persistence

**Problem**: In-memory continuation tokens were lost on service restart, causing reprocessing of events.

**Solution**: Implemented persistent storage using Azure Table Storage.

**Technical Details**:
- **Storage Account**: Reused existing storage account `stemaildevvwyhemail`
- **Table Name**: `continuationtokens` (configurable via environment)
- **Authentication**: DefaultAzureCredential with Storage Table Data Contributor role
- **Entity Structure**: 
  - PartitionKey: `changefeed`
  - RowKey: `docproc-parser-foundry` (consistent service identifier)
  - ContinuationToken: The actual Cosmos DB continuation token
  - LastUpdated: ISO timestamp of last update

**Configuration Added**:
```properties
AZURE_TABLE_STORAGE_ENABLED=true
AZURE_TABLE_STORAGE_TABLE_NAME=continuationtokens
```

**Files Created**:
- `continuation_token_storage.py`: Table Storage client with async operations
- Updated `config.py`: Added TableStorageConfig model
- Updated `pyproject.toml`: Added azure-data-tables dependency

#### 2. RBAC Configuration for Table Storage

**Issue**: Authentication failure accessing Table Storage with DefaultAzureCredential.

**Solution**: Added Storage Table Data Contributor role assignment in Terraform.

```hcl
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "current_user_storage_table_contributor" {
  scope                = azurerm_storage_account.main.id
  role_definition_name = "Storage Table Data Contributor"
  principal_id         = data.azurerm_client_config.current.object_id
}
```

#### 3. Sequential Processing Architecture Decision

**Decision**: Implemented sequential event processing for the MVP.

**Rationale**:
1. **Simplicity**: Single-threaded processing reduces complexity
2. **Debugging**: Easier to debug and trace event processing
3. **Resource Management**: Predictable resource usage patterns
4. **Error Handling**: Simplified error handling and recovery
5. **MVP Focus**: Sufficient for initial deployment and testing

**Implementation Details**:
- **Batch Processing**: Process Change Feed events one at a time using `async for`
- **Error Handling**: Individual event failures don't stop the processing loop
- **Token Management**: Continuation token updated after each successful batch
- **Backpressure**: Natural backpressure through sequential processing

**Processing Flow**:
1. Query Change Feed with continuation token
2. Process each event sequentially in the batch
3. Update continuation token after batch completion
4. Persist token to Table Storage (if enabled)
5. Continue polling with 5-second intervals

### Architecture Decisions

#### Change Feed Processing Strategy

**Current Implementation**: Pull-based polling with sequential processing
- **Polling Interval**: 5 seconds between Change Feed queries
- **Batch Size**: Default Cosmos DB batch size (controlled by service)
- **Processing**: Sequential event processing within each batch
- **Error Recovery**: 10-second delay on processing errors

**Future Considerations for Scale**:
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple processor instances with FeedRange partitioning
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple events concurrently within batches
- **Leader Election**: Coordinate multiple instances for high availability
- **Adaptive Polling**: Dynamic polling intervals based on event volume

#### Continuation Token Management

**Current Strategy**: Single service instance with persistent token storage
- **Storage**: Azure Table Storage with service-level key
- **Consistency**: One token per service instance
- **Recovery**: Automatic token loading on service startup
- **Fallback**: Start from beginning if no token found

**Future Scaling Strategy**:
- **FeedRange-based**: Multiple tokens for partitioned processing
- **Instance Coordination**: Token per processor instance with feed range
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent token updates

### Testing and Validation

**Functionality Verified**:
- ✅ Table Storage initialization and table creation
- ✅ Continuation token persistence and retrieval
- ✅ Service restart with token recovery
- ✅ Sequential event processing
- ✅ RBAC permissions for table access
- ✅ Graceful shutdown with resource cleanup

**Key Metrics**:
- **Processing Speed**: ~1-2 events per second (sequential)
- **Memory Usage**: Stable with in-memory token backup
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Token Persistence**: Sub-second storage operations

### Configuration Management

**Environment Variables Added**:
```properties
AZURE_TABLE_STORAGE_ENABLED=true|false
AZURE_TABLE_STORAGE_TABLE_NAME=continuationtokens
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=stemaildevvwyhemail
```

**Dependencies Added**:
- `azure-data-tables>=12.7.0`: Table Storage client library
