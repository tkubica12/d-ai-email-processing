# Implementation Log

## July 4, 2025 - Project Initialization

### Completed Tasks

#### 1.1 Initialize Azure Developer CLI project ✅
- **Action**: Ran `azd init` and configured project structure
- **Technical Decisions**:
  - Chose "Create a minimal project" option for clean start
  - Configured Terraform as infrastructure provider
  - Set up GitHub as pipeline provider
  - Used Function host type (closest match for Logic App workflows)
  
- **Files Created**:
  - `azure.yaml` - Main AZD configuration file
  - `.azure/config.json` - Environment configuration
  - `.azure/dev/.env.json` - Development environment settings
  - `src/logic-app/package.json` - Logic App project configuration
  
- **Directory Structure**:
  ```
  d-ai-email-processing/
  ├── .azure/
  │   ├── config.json
  │   └── dev/
  │       └── .env.json
  ├── infra/
  ├── src/
  │   └── logic-app/
  │       └── package.json
  ├── azure.yaml
  └── docs/
  ```

- **Configuration**:
  - Project name: `d-ai-email-processing`
  - Default environment: `dev`
  - Target region: `eastus`
  - Infrastructure: Terraform
  - Pipeline: GitHub Actions

### Next Steps
- Task 1.2: Create Terraform infrastructure modules ✅
- Set up storage account, Service Bus, and Logic App resources
- Configure managed identities and role assignments

### Notes
- AZD version 1.17.0 detected (1.17.2 available) - consider updating
- Logic App will be deployed as Function host type due to AZD limitations
- Environment variables configured for email mailbox (to be set later)

## July 4, 2025 - Terraform Infrastructure Implementation

### Completed Tasks

#### 1.2 Create Terraform infrastructure modules ✅
- **Action**: Created comprehensive Terraform infrastructure following best practices
- **Technical Decisions**:
  - Separated resources by type into individual files for maintainability
  - Added random string generation for resource name uniqueness
  - Used managed identities for secure service-to-service authentication
  - Configured appropriate RBAC assignments with principle of least privilege
  
- **Files Created**:
  - `infra/providers.tf` - Provider configuration (azurerm + random)
  - `infra/variables.tf` - Input variables with rich descriptions
  - `infra/resource_group.tf` - Resource group and naming locals
  - `infra/storage.tf` - Blob storage for email content/attachments
  - `infra/service_bus.tf` - Service Bus namespace and topic
  - `infra/logic_app.tf` - Logic App Standard and App Service Plan
  - `infra/rbac.tf` - Role assignments for managed identity
  - `infra/outputs.tf` - Output values for other components
  - `infra/README.md` - Infrastructure documentation
  - `infra/.gitignore` - Terraform-specific ignore rules
  
- **Infrastructure Architecture**:
  ```
  Resource Group (rg-d-ai-email-processing-dev-xxxx)
  ├── Storage Account (stdaiemailprocessingdevxxxxemail)
  ├── Service Bus Namespace (sb-d-ai-email-processing-dev-xxxx)
  │   └── Topic: email-events
  ├── App Service Plan (asp-d-ai-email-processing-dev-xxxx-logic)
  └── Logic App Standard (logic-d-ai-email-processing-dev-xxxx)
      └── Managed Identity with appropriate RBAC
  ```

- **Naming Strategy**:
  - Standard prefix: `{project}-{environment}-{4-random-letters}`
  - Storage-specific prefix: `{project}{environment}{4-random-letters}` (no dashes)
  - 4-character random suffix ensures global uniqueness

- **Security Configuration**:
  - Logic App uses system-assigned managed identity
  - RBAC assignments: Storage Blob Data Contributor, Service Bus Data Sender
  - Connection strings marked as sensitive outputs
  - Storage account includes versioning and soft delete

- **Validation**: Successfully passed `terraform validate`

### Infrastructure Deployment Success ✅
- **Action**: Successfully deployed infrastructure using `azd up`
- **Resources Created**:
  - Resource Group: `rg-email-dev-srng`
  - Storage Account: `stemaildevsrngemail`
  - Service Bus Namespace: `sb-email-dev-srng`
  - Service Bus Topic: `email-events`
  - Logic App Workflow: `logic-email-dev-srng`
  - Role Assignments: Storage Blob Data Contributor, Service Bus Data Sender

- **Architecture Decision**: 
  - Switched from Logic App Standard to Logic App Workflow (multitenant/consumption)
  - Simplified deployment and removed App Service Plan dependency
  - Maintains managed identity for secure service-to-service authentication

- **Deploy Status**: Infrastructure provisioned successfully
- **Next Challenge**: AZD deploy fails because Logic App workflow code is not yet implemented
- **Error Message**: `resource not found: unable to find a resource tagged with 'azd-service-name: logic-app'`
- **Root Cause**: This is expected - we need to implement the Logic App workflow definition (task 2.1)

### Task 1.2 Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Infrastructure is ready for Logic App workflow implementation.
