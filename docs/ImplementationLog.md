## 5. Critical Technical Fixes & Lessons Learned

**Event System Consistency:**
- **Issue**: Missing `documentId` in event data and inconsistent partition keys
- **Solution**: Standardized event data structure and corrected partition key usage (`submissionId`)
- **Impact**: Reliable event processing across all document services

**Pydantic & OpenAI Integration:**
- **Issue**: Complex nested models causing OpenAI structured output failures
- **Solution**: Flattened data models for better API compatibility
- **Learning**: OpenAI structured outputs work best with simple, flat schemas

**Event Serialization:**
- **Issue**: DateTime objects not JSON serializable in event emission
- **Solution**: Use `model_dump(mode='json')` for proper datetime handling
- **Impact**: Prevents runtime errors during event publishing

**Azure SDK Dependencies:**
- **Issue**: Missing Azure SDK packages causing import errors
- **Solution**: Explicitly declare all Azure SDK dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- **Learning**: Don't rely on transitive dependencies for Azure services

## 7. Company APIs Service Implementation

**Date**: July 11, 2025

**Service Overview:**
Implemented a FastAPI-based service that provides mock business data for AI agents to use during submission analysis. The service exposes RESTful APIs with realistic, consistent mock data generation.

**Key Implementation Decisions:**
1. **Mock Data Strategy**: Uses seeded random generation with user ID as seed for consistent results
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Replaced `zoneinfo` with `datetime.timezone.utc` for Windows compatibility
3. **Flexible User IDs**: Accepts any string as user ID, not just email addresses
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes

**Technical Architecture:**
- **FastAPI**: Modern Python web framework with automatic API documentation
- **Pydantic Models**: Type-safe request/response validation
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: Simplified mock authentication for development
- **Seeded Random Generation**: Consistent mock data per user using `abs(hash(user_id)) % (2**32)`

**API Endpoints Implemented:**
1. `GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/products` - User products and subscriptions
2. `GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/financial-score` - Financial health scores (5 types)
3. `GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/income` - Income data with configurable granularity

**Mock Data Features:**
- **Product Types**: Banking, insurance, investment, loan, credit, other
- **Financial Scores**: Composite, creditworthiness, liquidity, stability, growth
- **Income Granularity**: Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly aggregation
- **Realistic Ranges**: Sensible financial data ranges and relationships

**Common Issues Resolved:**
- **Missing ProductType.other**: Added missing product names and features for 'other' category
- **Timezone Compatibility**: Used `timezone.utc` instead of `ZoneInfo("UTC")` for Windows
- **Hash Consistency**: Used `abs(hash())` to avoid negative values in ID generation
- **Dependencies**: Added `tzdata` package for timezone support on Windows

**Testing Strategy:**
- REST Client file with comprehensive test cases
- Tests for all endpoints and error conditions
- Consistency tests to verify seeded random generation
- Support for both email and non-email user IDs
